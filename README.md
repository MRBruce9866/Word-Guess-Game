# Fallout Guessing Game

## Overview

Fallout Guessing Game is a hangman style game created by Markus Bruce. The theme of the game is inspired by the popular Fallout game series from Bethesda Game Studios. In the Fallout universe, you come across computer terminals that can contain game lore, minigames, or be used to 'hack' various obstacles that are locked away from the player. The terminal screens have a dark green background with forefront elements (text, images, ect.) being colored in bright green. The controls to interface the screen are simple, directional keys to cycle through the elements and ENTER to perform an action on that element. This style and simple navigation mechanic is imitated in Fallout Guessing Game as well as some of the Fallout game lore. 

## How the Game Works

The game starts by choosing a word at random from a predefined word bank. This word is hidden from the player so that the player can only see how many letters are in the word. The player must then try to figure out what the word is by picking a letter and seeing if the word contains that letter. If that letter is in the word, each position of that letter in the word is revealed. If the letter is not in the word, the player uses up one of their guesses and trys again. Play continues until the word is spelled out entirely (Play Wins) or the player uses up all of their guesses (Player Loses). Finally, each win or lost is counted and displayed to the player and a new round can begin.
